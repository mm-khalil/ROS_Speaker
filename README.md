# ROS Speaker

While creating a link between ROS and Arduino IDE makes life easy so that any code you write in an Arduino IDE and Run in an Arduino controller while it’s a ROS code is not something pretty haaan!

Here in this specific tutorial I write a Arduino code which is implemented on a speaker and a sound came out from it, speaker may be of any ohm that’s not a problem.
